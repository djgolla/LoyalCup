### Order Cards

Each order displays:

**Header:**

- 👤 **Customer Name** - Who to call for pickup

**Body:**
- 📝 **Items List** - All ordered items with quantities
- ✏️ **Customizations** - Size, milk type, extras (indented under item)
- 💬 **Special Instructions** - Customer notes (highlighted in yellow if present)

**Footer:**

## Handling Special Situations

Real-world scenarios and how to handle them like a pro!

### Situation 1: Customer is Late

**Scenario:** Order marked "Ready" 20+ minutes ago, no pickup

**Steps:**
1. **Check order details** for customer phone number
2. **Call or text customer:** "Hi [Name], your order #[1234] is ready for pickup at [Shop Name]. We'll hold it for you!"
3. **Move order to "hold" area** (if you have one) to clear pickup counter
4. **Keep warm/cold** as needed (refrigerate cold drinks, rewarm food if allowed)
5. **After 60 minutes with no contact:**
   - Inform manager
   - Manager decides: complete order, donate items, or dispose
   - Mark as completed with note: "No-show pickup"

> **💡 Tip:** Some shops have a "will call" shelf for late pickups. Organize by customer name!

---

### Situation 2: Out of Ingredients Mid-Shift

**Scenario:** You accepted an order for an oat milk latte, but just ran out of oat milk

**Immediate steps:**
1. **Don't proceed with order** - don't use substitute without permission
2. **Call customer immediately** (phone in order details)
3. **Explain situation:** "Hi [Name], we just ran out of oat milk for your latte. We have almond, soy, or whole milk available. Would any of those work?"

**If customer agrees to substitute:**
- Make the substitution
- Add note in order: "Customer approved: almond milk instead of oat"
- Continue with preparation

**If customer declines substitution:**
- Apologize sincerely
- Process refund (or offer shop credit)
- Mark order as cancelled with reason: "Out of ingredients - customer declined substitute"

**After resolving:**
- **Immediately update menu** to mark oat milk items unavailable
- **Inform manager** to restock or update menu
- **Apologize to any other customers affected**

---

### Situation 3: Incorrect Order Prepared

**Scenario:** You made a medium latte, but order shows large latte

**If caught BEFORE marking ready:**
1. **Remake correctly** - don't try to fix, start fresh
2. **Dispose of wrong item** or set aside for team
3. **Complete correctly** and proceed normally

**If caught AFTER customer pickup:**
1. **Customer returns or calls**
2. **Apologize immediately** - no excuses
3. **Remake order correctly on the spot** (priority rush)
4. **Offer something extra** if manager approves (free pastry, size upgrade on next visit)
5. **Log incident** for training purposes
6. **Team review** to prevent recurrence

> **🎯 Prevention:** Always verify order details before starting preparation, and double-check before marking ready!

---

### Situation 4: Unclear Special Instructions

**Scenario:** Customer wrote "make it how you usually do" or instruction is confusing

**Steps:**
1. **Call customer if phone provided** (preferred)
2. **Ask clarifying question:** "I want to make your drink perfectly - can you clarify what you mean by [instruction]?"
3. **If can't reach customer:** Use standard preparation, add note: "Unable to reach for clarification, prepared as standard [item name]"
4. **Inform manager** if instruction is problematic (inappropriate, impossible, unclear)

**Common unclear instructions and how to handle:**
- "Extra extra ice" → Fill cup to top with ice
- "Light caramel" → Half pumps of caramel
- "Make it sweet" → Add 2 extra pumps sweetener (or call to confirm how much)
- "Not too hot" → Serve at 140°F instead of 160°F
- "Surprise me" → Use house recommendation, note what you made

---

### Situation 5: Equipment Malfunction

**Scenario:** Espresso machine stops working mid-shift

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Stop accepting orders** requiring espresso
2. **Inform manager immediately**
3. **Check pending orders** - identify affected orders

**Communication:**

---

### Situation 6: Multiple Orders, Feeling Overwhelmed

**Scenario:** 8 orders in queue, more coming in, rush hour

**Stay calm strategy:**

2. **Triage:**
   - Accept all pending orders quickly
   - Sort by pickup time (ASAP first)
   - Group similar items (make 3 lattes together)
3. **Communicate:**
   - Ask coworkers for help
   - Tell manager if truly overwhelmed
4. **Work methodically:**
   - One order at a time
   - Don't rush and make mistakes
   - Use checklists
5. **Update customers if delays:**
   - Manager can send update via LoyalCup (if feature available)
   - Honesty is better than silence

**Team approach:**
- Worker 1: Drinks
- Worker 2: Food/packaging
- Worker 3: Customer handoffs and order completion

> **💪 Remember:** Every busy shift is a learning experience. You'll get faster with practice!

---

### Situation 7: Customer Dispute

**Scenario:** Customer claims order is wrong or items are missing

**De-escalation steps:**
1. **Stay calm and friendly** - never defensive
2. **Listen actively** - "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what's missing?"
3. **Apologize** - "I apologize for the confusion. Let me make this right."
4. **Verify order details** in system
5. **Resolve:**
   - If mistake on your end: Remake/add missing items immediately, no charge
   - If customer error: Politely show order details, offer to add item for cost

---

### Accidentally Clicked Wrong Button

**Problem:** Marked order as "Ready" but it's not actually ready!

**Fix:**

3. **If customer arrives:**
   - Apologize: "I'm so sorry, we're just finishing up your order now"
